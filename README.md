## Research Article 🔬
To get a more in-depth and technical overview of Drone Swarmer, you can refer to this [research article](#)

## Future Improvements 🚀
- Find a way to include multiple microcontroller boards to spoof more than 16 drones (current capacity)
- Create a localhost web server to display the spoofed drones on a map
- Look into possible MAC Address collission issues within the code that may be causing the 16 drone capacity limit (refer to research article)
